## 🎓 Learning Approach

### Philosophy

This guide follows three principles:

1. **Intuition First, Then Depth**
   * Understand "why" before "how"
   * Simple English explanations
   * Analogies and examples

2. **Code + Theory Together**
   * Every concept has code example
   * Run code to build intuition
   * Theory explains what you observe

3. **Practical Focus**
   * Everything is actionable
   * Real-world applications
   * No unnecessary complexity

---

## 💻 Code Labs

All labs are **fully runnable Python code** with:

* Clear explanations
* Working examples
* What to modify
* Extension ideas

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install openai anthropic google-generativeai
pip install sentence-transformers chromadb
pip install tiktoken
```

**Set API keys:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
```
