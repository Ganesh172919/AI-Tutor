      "message": "Perfect! That's all you need to start.\n\n**TL;DR:** A for loop repeats code a specific number of times automatically.\n\n**Simple Explanation:** Instead of writing the same code over and over, a for loop does it for you. You just tell it how many times to repeat.\n\n**Cooking analogy:** Imagine you're making 5 pancakes. Instead of saying 'pour batter, flip, remove' five separate times, you say 'for each pancake from 1 to 5, do: pour batter, flip, remove.' The loop handles the counting!",
