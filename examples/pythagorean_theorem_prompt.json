    "tldr": "In a right triangle, the longest side squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared.",
    "explanation": "The Pythagorean theorem is a formula for right triangles. A right triangle has one 90-degree corner, like the corner of a book. The formula says: a² + b² = c², where c is the longest side (called the hypotenuse).",
    "analogy": "Think of it like checking how much fabric you need. If you have two square pieces of fabric, one 3 inches and one 4 inches on each side, and you want one big square that uses the same total fabric, that big square would be 5 inches on each side. The areas of the small squares (9 + 16 = 25) equal the area of the big square (25).",
    "worked_example": "Problem: Find the longest side of a right triangle with sides 3 and 4.\n\nStep 1: Write the formula\na² + b² = c²\n\nStep 2: Put in the numbers\n3² + 4² = c²\n\nStep 3: Calculate the squares\n9 + 16 = c²\n\nStep 4: Add them up\n25 = c²\n\nStep 5: Take the square root\nc = √25 = 5\n\nAnswer: The longest side is 5.",
    "practice_question": "A right triangle has sides of 5 and 12. What is the length of the longest side (hypotenuse)?",
    "hint": "Square both numbers (5² and 12²), add them together, then take the square root of the result."
