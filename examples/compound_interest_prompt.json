    "tldr": "Compound interest means you earn interest on your interest, making money grow faster.",
    "explanation": "Compound interest is when your money earns interest, and then that interest also earns interest. It's like a snowball rolling downhill - it starts small but grows bigger and faster over time. The longer you wait, the more powerful it becomes.",
    "analogy": "Imagine you plant a money tree that grows 10% more branches each year. Year 1: You have 10 branches, and grow 1 more (10% of 10). Year 2: Now you have 11 branches, so you grow 1.1 more (10% of 11). Each year, you grow more branches because you have more branches to grow from. That's compound interest!",
    "worked_example": "Problem: You put $100 in a savings account with 10% yearly interest. How much after 3 years?\n\nYear 0 (Start): $100.00\n\nYear 1:\nInterest = $100 × 10% = $10.00\nNew balance = $100 + $10 = $110.00\n\nYear 2:\nInterest = $110 × 10% = $11.00\nNew balance = $110 + $11 = $121.00\n\nYear 3:\nInterest = $121 × 10% = $12.10\nNew balance = $121 + $12.10 = $133.10\n\nAfter 3 years: $133.10\n(You earned $33.10, not just $30!)",
    "practice_question": "You put $200 in a savings account with 5% yearly compound interest. How much will you have after 2 years?",
    "hint": "First, find 5% of $200 and add it. Then find 5% of that new amount and add it again."
