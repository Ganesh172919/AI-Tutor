      "message": "Perfect! You got it. A right triangle has one corner that's exactly 90 degrees - like the corner of a book or a door frame. Now let's learn the main concept.\n\n**TL;DR:** In a right triangle, the longest side squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared.\n\n**Simple Explanation:** The Pythagorean theorem is a formula: a² + b² = c². Here, 'a' and 'b' are the two shorter sides, and 'c' is the longest side (we call it the hypotenuse). It only works for right triangles.\n\n**Think of it like this:** Imagine you have two small square rugs. If you combine their areas, you get the area of one bigger square rug. The sides of those rugs are the sides of your triangle!",
